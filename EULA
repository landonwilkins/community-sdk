(b) ceases operation without a successor; or 
(c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days)).

6.	Limited Warranty and Disclaimer.

6.1	Limited Warranty. Emotiv warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the Effective Date (the "Warranty Period") the Software shall operate in substantial conformity with the Documentation. Emotiv does not warrant that your use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free or that any security mechanisms implemented by the Software will not have inherent limitations. Emotiv's sole liability (and your exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Emotiv's sole discretion, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an error-correction or work-around which corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Emotiv determines such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable period of time, to refund the license fee paid for the Software. Emotiv shall have no obligation with respect to a warranty claim unless notified of such claim within the Warranty Period. To the extent that Emotiv provides any warranty for hardware accompanying the Software, such hardware warranty shall not affect the warranty in this Section 6.1.

6.2	 Exclusions. The above warranty shall not apply: 
(i) if the Software is used with hardware or software not specified in the Documentation; 
(ii) if any modifications are made to the Software by you or any third party; 
(iii) to defects in the Software due to accident, abuse or improper use by you; or 
(iv) to Software provided on a no charge or evaluation basis.

6.3	Disclaimer of Warranties. THIS SECTION 6 IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6, THE SOFTWARE AND ALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". NEITHER EMOTIV NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.

7.	Limitation of Remedies and Damages.

7.1	NEITHER YOU NOR EMOTIV (INCLUDING EMOTIV'S SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. THIS SECTION 7.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM ARISING UNDER THE SECTIONS TITLED "GRANT OF LICENSE," "LICENSE RESTRICTIONS" OR "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION". 

7.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EMOTIV AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO EMOTIV UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

7.3	The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 7 will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

8.	Confidential Information. Any software, documentation or technical information provided by Emotiv (or its agents) shall be deemed "Emotiv Confidential Information" without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, you will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Emotiv Confidential Information. You acknowledge that disclosure of Emotiv Confidential Information would cause substantial harm to Emotiv that could not be remedied by the payment of damages alone and therefore that upon any such disclosure by you, Emotiv shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.

9.	Export Compliance. You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. You shall not, and shall not allow any third-party to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: 
(i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; 
(ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals; 
(iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or 
(iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You agree to the foregoing and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The Software is further restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of the United States government.

10. 	General.

10.1	Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Emotiv may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of Emotiv's assets or voting securities. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without Emotiv's written consent. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement without such written consent will be null and void.

10.2	Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.

10.3	Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of The State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.  The jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the California state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. 

10.4	Attorneys' Fees and Costs. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs in connection with such action.

No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.

10.7	Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No provision of any purchase order or in any other business form employed by you will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have entered into a separate written license agreement signed by Emotiv for use of the Software, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in this Agreement.

10.8	Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent.

10.9	Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.

10.10	Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software.  If the user or licensee of the Software is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes.
